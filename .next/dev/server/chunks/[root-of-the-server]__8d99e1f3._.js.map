Nociceptors (polymodal receptors) separate from primary thermoreceptors, respond noxious temperatures. Noxious Range: Temperatures 40-60°C (hot pain ~45°C), change firing rate as linear function temperature change (not logarithmic), cold nociceptors < 15°C.

Classification: (1) High-Threshold Mechanoreceptors - respond only intense mechanical stimulation (strong pressure, pinching), minimal other stimuli response.

Response: Respond minute skin punctures (millimeter-level damage), response magnitude depends tissue deformation degree (pressure intensity), graded response chemical irritants.
